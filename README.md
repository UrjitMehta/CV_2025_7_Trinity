# Improve Online Trackers with Feature Evolution Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to enhance existing online object trackers by measuring the feature evolution of objects in UAV videos. The focus is on evaluating the performance of ReID-based (Re-Identification) trackers in object tracking, considering feature evolution to handle cases where immediate detection may fail.

## Problem Statement
This study focuses on evaluating the performance ReID-based trackers in object tracking by considering feature evolution as immediate detection might fail. 
  - Traditional object tracking methods may struggle with immediate detection failures. This study investigates how ReID-based trackers can improve object tracking by leveraging feature evolution.

## Milestones & Deliverables
- **Research & Exploration:**
  - Identify and list various publicly available ReID-based object trackers.
  - Understand the evaluation criteria and dataset requirements.
  - Analyze ReID model architectures and their functioning.
- **Implementation:**
  - Deploy methods for matching temporally evolved features.
  - Develop a Python-based framework to evaluate the performance of ReID-based trackers in object tracking.
  - Prepare a ground-truth for a given video to benchmark performance.

- **Final Deliverables:**
  - Deliver the final framework as an open-source tool.
  - Provide benchmarking results and performance insights.
 
## Models & Dataset
- **Models:**
  - Utilize pre-trained ReID models for framework development.
- **Dataset:**
  - **VisDrone Tracking Dataset** (for training and evaluation)
